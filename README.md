Rubik's Cube Simulator

--------------------------------------------

This was a project done for my first Java class. The user picks some moves and puts them in via the command line. The program then reads this, does the opposite of each move, and solves the cube given the state by the user. It's a fairly long program and not optimized but gets the job done. 

The uppercase and lower case will be the move and its reverse. Each time the user picks one move and the program outputs the opposite. The cube will also be printed each time with the current changes showing. 

>taken from the command line

Example: 

javac cube.java

java cube.java
